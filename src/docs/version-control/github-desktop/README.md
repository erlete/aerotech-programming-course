GitHub Desktop is the application interface for GitHub Web. It allows a more direct interaction between the user and GitHub/Git features that are available on the web.

I personally recommend its usage, specially for beginners, since it makes working with the interface an easy task. Using Git directly might be the cause for plenty of difficulties, yet advanced users are more than welcome to use it.

## Download

This software can be downloaded through [its download page](https://desktop.github.com). Make sure to choose the correct operating system and hardware architecture version.

## Installation

In order to install GitHub Desktop you only need to run the installer and add your profile configuration (your name and email, same as in your GitHub account). Furthermore, you might need to log in with your GitHub account in order to be able to access your remote repositories.

### Validation

You can make sure the installation was successful by searching for "GitHub Desktop" in the list of installed applications. It's a complicated process, I know.

## Repository Setup

In order to start editing the repository and adding your own developments, you will need to clone it in your computer. You will learn how to do that in [**the next chapter**](./SETUP.md).

If you want to go back to [the previous chapter](../github/SETUP.md), go ahead!
