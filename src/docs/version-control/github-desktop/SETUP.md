# Repository Setup

> ***Estimated completion time: 5 minutes***

You have already forked the repository, but it only exists on a remote server (GitHub's). It would be nice to have a local copy (in your PC) and be able to modify it as you wish, right? Let's do it.

## Cloning the repository

The cloning process is part of Git core functionality. It consists on the invocation of the `git` command and the `clone` argument. After that, another argument is passed, the URL of your repository, which looks like `https://github.com/<your username>/<name of the repository>`. If you feel like being a tryhard, go ahead and clone it that way. If you want to go down the easy path, open GitHub Desktop and clone it using the graphical interface.

In the GitHub Desktop application toolbar, click "File", then "Clone repository..." and select the one used for this course.

## Python

Python is a versatile programming language that is used in a wide variety of fields, such as web development, data science, machine learning, and many others. You will learn how to install and use it in [**the next chapter**](/docs/python/interpreter/README.md).

If you want to go back to [the previous chapter](./README.md), go ahead!
