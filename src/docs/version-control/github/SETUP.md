# GitHub Setup

> ***Estimated completion time: 10 minutes***

The first step to start collaborating in GitHub is to create an account. You can do so [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home). If you already have an account, no need to create another one. Just make sure to try and comply with the following rules (also applicable to new members).

- **Add a descriptive name to your profile**: you can choose any nickname for the account, but keep the displayed name clear and understandable (i.e. @erlete / Paulo SÃ¡nchez). After all, this might end up being your developer CV.
- **Add a relevant image to your profile**: make sure to impact people visiting your profile with a relevant image. It surely adds a professional touch.
- **Build up your Overview**: elaborate a curated overview description in order to describe your abilities and ambitions.

## Forking the repository

The next step is to fork this repository and make it all yours! No need to copy other branches apart from the `stable` one. In case you forgot how to fork a repository, don't worry, [I've got you covered](./README.md#forks-git).

You can also hit the star button to highlight the repository and give some appreciation to the maintainers :D

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop represents the friendly, powerful desktop interface for GitHub, all from the comfort of your own computer environment. You will learn all about it in [**the next chapter**](../github-desktop/README.md).

If you want to go back to [the previous chapter](./README.md), go ahead!
