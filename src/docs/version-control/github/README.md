GitHub is an excellent collaboration tool for development teams and a great way to share your code with the world. It is also a great way to learn how to use Git, since it is the most popular Git repository hosting service.

## A social network for developers

The platform is based on the core functionality of the Git version control system, but it is not the same as Git itself. GitHub is just an interface. Do not forget that. However, it is easier to learn Git by using GitHub, since it provides a graphical interface to perform most of the Git operations, which would be performed over the command line otherwise.

*[Here is a video](https://blogs.motiondevelopment.top/blog/posts/git-and-github) that shows how to earn lots of money using GitHub.*

## Index

Since the contents of this lesson are somewhat complex, here is an index for better orientation:

- Repositories
- Commits
- Branches
- Forks
- Merge Requests and Merge Conflicts
- Pull Requests
- Issues
- Projects
- Discussions
- Actions

*In order to avoid confusion, all features described in this document are followed by a reference to the software tool that implements them (either Git, GitHub or both).*

## Repositories (Git)

A repository is the home for your code. It can be **public** or **private**, and it can contain as many files as you want (of course, with some limitations, such as individual file size and total repository size). It can also contain directories, which are used to organize said files.

![Repository](/.media/version-control/github/repository.png)

## Commits (Git)

A commit represents **a modification or set of modifications** performed in a repository. It is the basic unit of change in Git, and it is used to **track the contribution history** of a repository. A commit always contains a **commit message**, which is a short description of the changes made, and the actual changes themselves. Additionally, it can contain another message, which is used as extended description when it is required.

![Commit](/.media/version-control/github/commit.png)

## Branches (Git)

Branches are **parallel versions of any given state of a repository**. They are the key to collaborative development, since **they allow multiple developers to work on the same repository without affecting each other**. Branches are created from a given commit in another branch, and they can be merged back into the original branch when the work is done.

A **main branch** is always present on every repository, since if there were no branches, no commits could be made. This branch is often called `master` by default, but it can be renamed to any other name. This is a good practice to avoid using the default name, since [it can be considered offensive for some people](https://www.theserverside.com/feature/Why-GitHub-renamed-its-master-branch-to-main).

A common combination of branches are the `stable`-`dev` couple, which represent **stable versions** of the repository and **in-development ones**, respectively.

```mermaid

%%{
    init: {
        'logLevel': 'debug',
        'theme': 'base',
        'gitGraph': {
            'showBranches': true,
            'showCommitLabel':true,
            'mainBranchName': 'stable'
        }
    }
}%%

gitGraph
    commit id: "commit 1.1"
    commit id: "commit 1.2"
    branch dev
    checkout dev
    commit id: "commit 2.1"
    commit id: "commit 2.2"
    checkout stable
    merge dev id: "merged branch"
    commit id: "commit 1.3"
    commit id: "commit 1.4"
    commit id: "commit 1.5"
    commit id: "commit 1.6"
    commit id: "commit 1.7"
```

Commits are named using [**hashes**](https://medium.com/@jonathan_finch/git-commit-hash-number-theory-770f67ec492d) in order to generate a **unique identification** for each one of them.

```mermaid

%%{
    init: {
        'logLevel': 'debug',
        'theme': 'base',
        'gitGraph': {
            'showBranches': true,
            'showCommitLabel':true,
            'mainBranchName': 'stable'
        }
    }
}%%

gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch dev
    checkout dev
    commit
    commit
    checkout stable
    merge dev
    commit
    commit
    commit
    commit
    commit
```

Here is an example of a more complex branch system that emulates Autonomous System development:

```mermaid
%%{
    init: {
        'logLevel': 'debug',
        'theme': 'base',
        'gitGraph': {
            'showBranches': true,
            'showCommitLabel': true,
            'mainBranchName': 'stable'
        }
    }
}%%

gitGraph
    commit id: "initial-commit-1"

    branch dev
    commit id: "initial commit-2"

    branch camera-software-installation
    commit
    commit

    checkout dev
    branch mpc-development
    commit
    commit

    checkout camera-software-installation
    commit

    checkout dev
    merge mpc-development

    commit id: "actions-update-1"

    checkout camera-software-installation
    commit

    merge dev

    checkout dev
    merge camera-software-installation
    commit id: "actions-update-2"

    checkout stable
    merge dev
    commit id: "actions-update-3"

    checkout dev
    merge stable

    branch slam-investigation
    commit
    commit
    commit

    checkout dev
    merge slam-investigation

    commit id: "actions-update-4"

    checkout stable
    merge dev

    commit id: "actions-update-5"
```

## Forks (Git)

Forks are **copies of a repository**. They are used to generate a fresh replica of the latest state of a repository for your own purposes, so that **you can change it without affecting the original repository**. This is a great way to contribute to open-source projects, or even to create your own version of a project and develop it independently.

Any repository can be forked as long as the user has access to it. Forking a repository is as simple as clicking the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.

![Fork button](/.media/version-control/github/fork-1.png)

Clicking that button will cause a new window to open, asking for details on how to fork the repository. The default options are usually fine, but you can change them if you want. Note that you cannot fork a repository into the same account it belongs to.

![Fork options](/.media/version-control/github/fork-2.png)

The *"Copy only the `stable` branch only"* option can be used to only fork the main branch of the repository, in this case, named `stable`. This is useful in case the repository has multiple branches, and you only want to fork the most relevant one.

## Merge Requests and Merge Conflicts (Git)

A merge request is a **low-level petition to merge a branch into another one**. A merge request is composed of a **base branch** and a **source one**. The base branch is the one that will **receive the changes**, while the source branch is the one that **will be merged into the base branch**.

The low-level nature of merge requests is due to the fact that their objective is to determine whether or not the changes present in each branch are compatible, that is, whether the **lines** of the files that have been modified share the same state. You might wonder why this would be a problem, so let's take a look at an example:

1. There are two branches, `A` and `B`.
2. There are two developers, `X` and `Y`.
3. `X` commits changes to the `A` branch, while `Y` commits changes to the `B` branch.
4. `X` modifies `File1` in the `A` branch, while `Y` modifies `File1` in the `B` branch.
5. `Y` attempts to merge the `B` branch into the `A` branch.
6. Which version of the file should be used? The one from `X` or the one from `Y`?

Note that this issue is not trivial, since `X` could have modified `File1` **after** `Y` did, but `Y` requested a merge after `X` performed the modification, so the last modification of `File1` does not match the last modification on the repository (new changes are overwritten).

```mermaid
%%{
    init: {
        'logLevel': 'debug',
        'theme': 'base',
        'gitGraph': {
            'showBranches': true,
            'showCommitLabel':true,
            'mainBranchName': 'A'
        }
    }
}%%

gitGraph
    branch B

    commit id: "Modify File1 by Y"
    checkout A
    commit id: "Some change"

    commit id: "Modify File1 by X"
    checkout B
    commit id: "Some other change"
    checkout A
    merge B id: "Merge B into A"
```

When this happens, a **merge conflict** is generated. This is a situation in which the changes present in the source branch cannot be merged into the base branch, since they are incompatible. This is a very common situation, and it is important to know how to deal with it. Fortunately, Git provides with a simple solution to this problem: when a merge conflict is detected, the merge request is halted and the user is prompted to solve the conflict. This is done by modifying the conflicting file or files in order to make them compatible with the base branch.

### Merge Strategies (Git)

There are three main ways to merge branches in Git, each one with its own advantages and disadvantages.

| Strategy | Linear history | Prioritizes most recent changes |
| -------- | :------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| Standard | No             | No                              |
| Squash   | Yes            | No                              |
| Rebase   | Yes            | Yes                             |

Let's consider the following (conflictless) scenario in order to study the differences between strategies:

```mermaid
%%{
    init: {
        'logLevel': 'debug',
        'theme': 'base',
        'gitGraph': {
            'showBranches': true,
            'showCommitLabel':true,
            'mainBranchName': 'A'
        }
    }
}%%

gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial commit"
    branch B

    commit id: "Change B1"
    checkout A
    commit id: "Change A1"
    checkout B
    commit id: "Change B2"
    checkout A
    merge B id: "Merge B into A"
```

#### Standard (Merge)

This is the default strategy. **It mixes commits on the timeline**, which means that commits on both branches will preserve their original order.

```mermaid
%%{
    init: {
        'logLevel': 'debug',
        'theme': 'base',
        'gitGraph': {
            'showBranches': true,
            'showCommitLabel':true,
            'mainBranchName': 'A'
        }
    }
}%%

gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial commit"
    commit id: "Change B1" type: HIGHLIGHT
    commit id: "Change A1"
    commit id: "Change B2" type: HIGHLIGHT
    commit id: "Merge B into A"
```

Although this strategy is the most common one, it might cause the commit log to be hard to understand, since multiple commits will suddenly appear on the base branch history in a non-linear order.

#### Squash

This strategy **does not mix commits on the timeline**, which means that commits on the base branch will keep their linearity.

Furthermore, this strategy combines all the commits on the source branch into a single one, which is later merged into the base branch. This greatly simplifies the understanding of the commit log.

```mermaid
%%{
    init: {
        'logLevel': 'debug',
        'theme': 'base',
        'gitGraph': {
            'showBranches': true,
            'showCommitLabel':true,
            'mainBranchName': 'A'
        }
    }
}%%

gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial commit"
    commit id: "Change A1"
    commit id: "Merge B into A (Change B1, Change B2)" type: HIGHLIGHT
```

#### Rebase

This strategy **does not mix commits on the timeline**, which means that commits on the base branch will keep their linearity.

This strategy is not commonly used, since it mixes parts of both the standard and squash ones. It adds all the commits from the source branch to the base branch in their particular order (not combined), but sets them as the most recent on the base branch.

```mermaid
%%{
    init: {
        'logLevel': 'debug',
        'theme': 'base',
        'gitGraph': {
            'showBranches': true,
            'showCommitLabel':true,
            'mainBranchName': 'A'
        }
    }
}%%

gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial commit"
    commit id: "Change A1"
    commit id: "Merge B into A"
    commit id: "Change B1" type: HIGHLIGHT
    commit id: "Change B2" type: HIGHLIGHT
```

## Pull Requests (Git, GitHub)

A pull request (PR) is a **petition to merge a branch into another branch when the user does not have sufficient rights to commit directly to said branch**. They can be used to create a halted state between development and implementation, which is useful when there are lots of changes that require exhaustive revisions. Automatic actions can also halt the PR process in order to automatically verify that new changes are properly implemented.

PRs are listed in the pull request tab of a repository:

![Pull request interface](/.media/version-control/github/pull-request-1.png)

New PRs can be created clicking the *"New Pull Request"* button. After that, a new window will open:

![New Pull Request](/.media/version-control/github/pull-request-2.png)

They key information in this window is the bar that shows which branches are being compared, as well as whether they can be automatically merged. Note how it depicts both **base** and **compare (source)** branches, with a very descriptive arrow that indicates the direction of the changes.

![Pull Request comparison](/.media/version-control/github/pull-request-3.png)

We will take a deeper look at PRs after [Actions](#actions-github) have been explained.

## Issues (GitHub)

Issues are the **standard method of problem report, enhancement proposal or simple organization tool**. They are petitions that can be created using the issues' interface:

![Issues interface](/.media/version-control/github/issue-1.png)

In order to create a new issue, just click the big, green *"New issue"* button. A new interface will pop up:

![Issue creation interface](/.media/version-control/github/issue-2.png)

The issue is composed of a **title** and a **description**. It is important to be clear while writing requests in these fields, since they have to be understandable to the rest of developers.

Furthermore, there is a sidebar with multiple options on the right side of the screen:

![Issue creation bar](/.media/version-control/github/issue-3.png)

All these fields have got a meaning:

- **Assignees**: the set of people assigned to the resolution of the issue.
- **Labels**: additional classifiers for the issue.
- **Projects**: organization schemas that include the issue.
- **Milestone**: development goal that the issue contributes to.
- **Development**: list of linked PRs that aim to resolve the issue.

## Projects (GitHub)

Projects are a very useful tool for collaborative (and even individual) development, since **they help organize a set of issues and/or PRs in order to plan the evolution of a project**.

Projects can be created directly from your GitHub profile, and can later be linked to one or more repositories. Here is an example of a release schedule for multiple repositories:

![Projects example 1](/.media/version-control/github/project-1.png)

![Projects example 2](/.media/version-control/github/project-2.png)

As you can see, there are multiple ways to organize information in Projects, which can aid developing by adding clarity over the tasks that have to be done.

## Discussions (GitHub)

Discussions are, essentially, **forums for the developers of a project**. They can be used to discuss polemic issues in which many people want to express their opinion, brainstorming, tutorials... anything you can imagine.

They can be accessed through the tabs of most repositories:

![Discussions main screen](/.media/version-control/github/discussions-1.png)

A very good example of what Discussions are useful for is the Q&A system:

![Questions and answers in Discussions](/.media/version-control/github/discussions-2.png)

Furthermore, they can be used to pin tutorials for some specific functionalities that are implemented in the repository:

![Discussion tutorials](/.media/version-control/github/discussions-3.png)

## Actions (GitHub)

Actions are **the key for project automation and constant development**. They are scripts of code that are executed upon specific events during the development process (i.e. a commit that has been pushed, a branch that has been merged...).

There is no need to dive into the complexity of actions in this course, since it would be excessively long. Let's just take a look at the Actions interface:

![Actions interface](/.media/version-control/github/actions-1.png)

Each green/red dot represents an executed workflow, which is a script that contains a set of instructions to be executed remotely. These instructions can either pass or fail

This functionality can be used for automatic PR revisions, for example, by implementing a workflow that tests your program against multiple versions of a language. If the workflow fails, you will not be allowed to merge the PR until you fix the changes.

## GitHub Setup

You will need to create a GitHub account in order to fully explore this course and all the possibilities that GitHub has to offer. Do it in [**the next chapter**](./SETUP.md).

If you want to go back to [the previous chapter](../git/README.md), go ahead!
