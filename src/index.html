          </h4>
          <div class="text-block">
            It is a known fact that tailored education works better when it comes to reduced groups of
            people that might or might not have prior experience in the topic. This course will allow both
            beginner and experienced users to enjoy the learning process, discover new functionalities and
            even getting new ideas for their own development.

            How to follow the course?
          </h4>
          <div class="text-block">
            It is really to follow this course, since each content is extensively explained and organized in
            a way that the learning curve is smooth and beginner-friendly, without sacrificing complex
            information. You will start by setting up your environment for collaborative development, then
            you will learn the basics of Python programming in order to be able to develop your own projects
            and collaborate with other people.

          <div class="text-block">
            Since this course starts from scratch, an environment setup is required. This includes download,
            installation and configuration of a version control system (<b>Git</b>), a programming language
            (<b>Python</b>), a code editor (<b>Visual Studio Code</b>) and external tools that make collaborative
            development easier for beginners and experienced users alike (such as <b>GitHub Desktop</b>).

            This part of the course focuses on the basics of version control, attempting to explain the
            core concepts of this development methodology in a somewhat interactive and easy-to-understand
            way. It is important to understand the basics of version control before moving on to the next
            part of the course, since it is the foundation of collaborative development.

            Due to the fact that this programming course focuses on a beginner-friendly learning methodology, Python
            was
            chosen as programming language. It is a <b>high-level</b> programming language, which means that it is
            easier to read and write than other languages such as <em>C++</em> or <em>Java</em>. It is also a
            <b>multi-paradigm</b> (general-purpose) language, which means that it can be used for almost anything,
            from
            web development to data science or machine learning.
