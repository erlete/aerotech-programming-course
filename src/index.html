            It is a known fact that tailored education works better when it comes to reduced groups of

            beginner and experienced users to enjoy the learning process, discover new functionalities and
            even getting new ideas for their own development.

          </h5>
          <div class="block antialiased font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4 font-normal text-gray-600">
            It is really to follow this course, since each content is extensively explained and organized in
            a way that the learning curve is smooth and beginner-friendly, without sacrificing complex
            information. You will start by setting up your environment for collaborative development, then
            you will learn the basics of Python programming in order to be able to develop your own projects
            and collaborate with other people.

          <div class="block antialiased font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4 font-normal text-gray-600">
            Since this course starts from scratch, an environment setup is required. This includes download,
            installation and configuration of a version control system (<b>Git</b>), a programming language
            (<b>Python</b>), an
            <em>Integrated Development Environment</em> (<b>Visual Studio Code</b>) and external tools that make
            collaborative
            development easier for beginners and experienced users alike (such as <b>GitHub Desktop</b>).

          </h5>
          <div class="block antialiased font-sans text-base leading-relaxed mb-4 font-normal text-gray-600">
            Due to the fact that this programming course focuses on a beginner-friendly learning methodology, Python was
            chosen as programming language. It is a <b>high-level</b> programming language, which means that it is
            easier to read and write than other languages such as <em>C++</em> or <em>Java</em>. It is also a
            <b>multi-paradigm</b> (general-purpose) language, which means that it can be used for almost anything, from
            web development to data science or machine learning.

            At this point, you will already have set up your environment for collaborative development and completed the
            Python
            programming course. Then, you can start developing your own projects and collaborate with other people!

            You can also use all the new knowledge and feedback you have acquired through the course to try and improve
            it. Remember that this is an open-source project, so you can contribute to it by adding new content, fixing
            typos, adding more complex ideas or even translating it to other languages!
