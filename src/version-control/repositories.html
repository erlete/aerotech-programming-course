                        At a local level, a repository is just a directory on your computer with some special files in
                        it, such as the <code>.git</code> directory. The <code>.git</code> directory contains all the
                        information that is required for Git to track the history of your project and notice any changes
                        that happen to the files in it.

                        A remote repository is exactly the same as a local repository, except that it is stored on a
                        remote server. This remote server can be a dedicated Git hosting service, such as GitHub or
                        GitLab, or it can be a server that you have set up yourself (even an external storage device
                        can work as a <em><code>git</code> server</em>).

                        As it has been said before, repositories are not just directories. They offer extra
                        functionalities that can be very useful for developers that want to keep track of their code
                        changes, collaborate with other developers, and deploy their code to isolated production
                        environments. After all, without repositories, there would be no version control.
