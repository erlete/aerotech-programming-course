            Pull Requests (PRs) are <b>petitions to merge a branch into another branch when the user does not have
              sufficient rights to perform a direct commit</b>. They can be used to create a halted state between
            development and implementation, which is useful when there are lots of changes that require exhaustive
            revisions. PRs are also useful to <b>discuss changes</b> before they are implemented, since they can be
            commented and reviewed by other developers.

            Issues vs Pull Requests
          </h4>
          <div class="text-block">
            Issues and PRs are similar in the sense that they are both used to <b>discuss changes</b> before they are
            implemented. However, they are different in the sense that <b>issues are used to expose problems or
              potential implementations</b>, while <b>PRs are used to discuss solutions, including proposed changes</b>.
            In other words, issues represent <b>what</b> the problem or suggestion is, whereas PRs represent <b>how</b>
            the problem or suggestion should be solved.
