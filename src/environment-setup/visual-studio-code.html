            Visual Studio Code (commonly known as VSCode) is a relatively lightweight editor (not IDE) for code
            development. It is highly versatile and has got support for almost all platforms.

          <h4>
            Why is Visual Studio Code important?
          </h4>
          <div class="text-block">
            This might be a question for the more skeptical students. Why should I use VSCode instead of other editors
            such as Notepad++, Sublime Text or the infamous Vim? The answer is simple: VSCode is a very powerful editor
            that can be used for almost any programming language and development environment, mainly due to its endless
            customization possibilities and the large community behind it. And this is not an opinion, <a

              target="_blank">but a fact</a>.

          <h4>
            Visual Studio Code extensions
          </h4>
          <div class="text-block">
            As the name implies, VSCode <b>extensions</b> are pieces of software that can be installed in the editor to
            extend its functionality. There are thousands of extensions available, and they can be installed from the
            <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode" target="_blank">VSCode Marketplace</a>.
          </div>
          <div class="text-block">
            There is a higher level of extension and settings combination, called <b>profiles</b>. Profiles are sets of
            configurations and extensions that can be easily installed and switched between, ideal for suiting each one
            of your development environments (e.g. Python development, Frontend, Backend, etc.).
